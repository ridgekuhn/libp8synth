## Notice

Code in this directory is provided as a reference and will most likely not be maintained, due to the unpredictability of [memory addressing](/memory.md#notice) and variable/function names in web exports generated by Pico-8.

## Installation

In the exported `.js` file:

* Locate the `asm` object scope and remove all functions listed in the "Re-minify function names" section of [constants.js](/src/web/constants.js).

* Open each file in this directory and paste the contents anywhere in the exported `.js` file. In Javascript, function and variable declarations are [hoisted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting) before execution, so the order and location of pasted content does not matter, as long as it is in or above the `asm` object's scope.

## Installation

* Identify the channel oscillator mixing function and remove it. In the 0.2.7 export, it is named `Nq()`.

* Paste the contents of [./audio/mix_osc_tick.js](./audio/mix_osc_tick.js) anywhere in the file, ensuring that the function has the same name as the function removed in the step above.

* Paste [./audio/mix_reverb.js](./audio/mix_reverb.js), and [./audio/oscillators/aliased](./audio/oscillators/aliased) anywhere in the file.
